The Machine Learning internship project at Prodigi Infotech entails developing a model that uses linear regression to forecast home prices. A dataset from Kaggle's House Pricing Competition is used for this, and it contains information on square footage as well as the quantity of bedrooms and bathrooms. The objective is to use machine learning techniques—more specifically, linear regression—to successfully address cost estimating problems.
